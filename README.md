WIP

An implementation of text editor with Rust.

This is a hobby project just for my study, but I'm trying to make it as much as practical.

This editor is roughly based on [kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo) and following the tutorial:

- https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/

And thank you for other great implementations of kilo:

## Start

```sh
git clone git@github.com:inokawa/rust-editor.git
cd rust-editor
cargo run "path/to/file.txt"
```
